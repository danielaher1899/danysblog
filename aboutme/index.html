	<p> I am a <span class= "highlight"> Journalism, Media and Publishing student at Oxford Brookes University.</span></p>
			<img class= "chile" src="img/chile.jpg">
<section>
Originally from <span class="highlight"> Puerto Montt, Chile &#128507;.</span>
</section>


	<p> After I finished school in 2016, I took a gap year and came to Europe to improve my English, experience the world outside Chile and decide whether journalism was for me or not. </p>

	<p>Today my aim is to work as a journalist <span class="highlight">covering environmental issues &#127757;.</span></p>

	   <img class="fact_image" src= "img/environment.jpg">  <img class="fact_image" src= "img/earth.jpg">


	<p> I see the study and practice of journalism as an essential weapon <span class="highlight"> in the fight against injustice.</span>
	One of the greatest opportunities I have had is to write articles for the <span class="highlight"> Oxford Mail,</span> which has given me the oportunity to learn much more about this career.</p>
	  <img class="fact_image" src= "img/oxmail.jpg">   <img class="fact_image" src= "img/article.jpg">
<div>
	  <p>I love arts! During my free time I like to <span class="highlight"> dance, sing, paint and during the pandemic I learned how to embroider.</span></p>
	   <img class="other_image" src= "img/bees.jpg">

	</div>
	<p> Also as a hobbie, I have started a <span class="highlight"> podcast </span> where I talk about current affairs and I invite women from different backgrounds to participate as speakers.</p>

				 <img src="img/spotify.png"></a>

	<p> The title of the podcast means "Global and Conscious", most of my content is in Spanish (sorry!) as it is my first language. <span class= "highlight">I am also learning Italian and French.<span></p>
	<p> I have a Youtube and  <a class="fact_link" href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-fjuClltcS/?hl=en" target="blank"> IGTV channel </a>. the topics I discuss are varied, <span class="highlight"> including my travel experiences, feminism, film reviews, environment and my experience as an international student in the UK.</span>

		<p> My university experience has been great so far, being the president of the latino society has helped me to connect with my roots and appreciate my culture even more &#128511;&#129368;&#127865;.</p>


		 <img class="chile" src= "img/latino.jpg">

  	<p>I love to travel and I would like to <span class="highlight">keep learning about different cultures as much as possible!</span></p>
