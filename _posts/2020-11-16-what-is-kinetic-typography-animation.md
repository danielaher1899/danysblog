Having too much text on the screen can be overwhelming for viewers, but when done properly text-based videos can be entertaining and effective. In this post I will explain how kinetic typography works, its benefits and some tips to start creating!

Kinetic typography or also known as "fast typography" is an animation technique, which mixes motion and typography to convey ideas and evoke emotion. 

In an era where weâ€™re constantly overwhelmed by the amount of information being thrown at us, the popularity of templates that help deliver messages in fast, visually engaging ways has risen.

Typography seems to be everywhere right now, you might utilise kinetic text to emphasise a portion of a long audio recording, to advertise your product on social media, or to help your viewer remember terms more easily. Commercials, music videos, mobile apps, and websites use it to make their words more impactful and add an element of artistry.

This popularity could come from a number of reasons:

* **Attraction and Retention.** 
* **Great for highlighting important points.**
* **It is fun to watch.**
* **You don't need to listen to it.** A recent study found that around 85% of the FB users viewed the video in a mute mode. By using moving texts in the video, you can pass the message without any sound and still get to the audience.
* **A text-based video does not cost a lot of money to create and publish.**

Here some tips to create your own kinetic video:

* **Short, Effective, and Informative:** A typography video has built a reputation of being short and to the point.Internet users want to watch and engage with shorter videos and do not usually want to spend a lot of time with a single creator. 
* **Write out your full script** and highlight or bold the words and phrases that are most important. These will be the elements that get extra design emphasis when you create your video.
* **Experiment with fonts and animation options.**
* **Try not to overload the viewer with too many words on the screen at once, one sentence at a time is a good starting point.**

Using kinetic typography can be a fun tool. Moveable type can add impact, emotional connection and visual interest to digital and video projects. Vyond Studio is a good resource to start creating, there are many templates you can use and tutorials for begginers.
