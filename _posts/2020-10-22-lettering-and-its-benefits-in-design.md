Is it lettering the same as typography or calligraphy? Although typography and lettering share many of the same concepts they are completely different disciplines. Understanding how lettering works and how to use it can be a huge benefit for a designer. 

What is lettering?

Lettering can be simply defined as “the art of drawing letters”. The difference between a type designer and a lettering artist is that the first one designs the letters to be used repetitively, while the lettering artist draws letters for a single usage. Usually lettering is hand-drawn, but some artists start their work directly with Adobe Illustrator.

Typography is used for endless applications from titles to body text, while lettering is mostly used as a display text as it would take a lot of effort to use it for writing paragraphs. 

Is it not the same as calligraphy?

Again, although calligraphy and lettering are related, they are not the same. To explain it in simple words calligraphy is essentially based on writing letters, and lettering is drawing letters. One of the biggest differences is that calligraphy aims at the perfection of style while lettering is popular due to the freedom of the presentation.

The arts of both lettering and calligraphy have been around since time immemorial and have evolved together.
